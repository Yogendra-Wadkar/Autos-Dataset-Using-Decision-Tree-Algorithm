- 📁 **Project_Description:** Briefly outlines the project's purpose and goals.

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that models the relationship between the dependent variable (auto price) and one or more independent variables. In our context, it helps establish a linear equation to predict auto prices.

### Decision Trees

Decision Trees are powerful algorithms that recursively split the dataset based on the most significant attributes. This segmentation helps in predicting auto prices with high accuracy.
